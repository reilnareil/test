  Road bikes are best identified by their drop or turned-down handlebars and
  skinny tires. The downward-curving handlebars are usually super lightweight
  that help put you in an aerodynamic position. The lightweight frame makes this
  type of bicycle particularly good for numerous pavement uses including racing,
  touring, fitness riding, long-distance rides and daily commuting. The large,
  thin tires allow you to glide the bike along various terrains with zero to
  little effort. If you are supremely concerned about speed, varied options for
  hand and riding positions, and an efficient transference of energy into
  propelling the bike forward, a road bike is the best option for you.
